> The restoration of old buildings in major cities throughout the world often involves numerous government expenditure. This money will bring more benifits if it is used to provide new housing or road development. To what extend do you agree or disagree.

The government spends plenty of money on the restoration of old buildings nowadays. At the same time, it supports the development of new buildings and roads. From my point of view, it can bring more benefits if the government distributes more finance in building new architectures and modern transportation networks.

Initially, with the advancement of technology, people are pursuing a better standard of life which means a modern and stable infrastructure is significant. In the old downtown of Macao, there are many outdated apartments. Moreover, related infrastructure like the drainage system has been in use for many decades. When suffering from a typhoon, this area is always the most affected. Consequently, the SAR government has taken action in building new apartments in the underdevelopment area in Taipa. Many residents are moving out to new houses and enjoying a better life quality.

On the other hand, although it is vital to protect historical and cultural buildings. It is reasonable to amend a small part of them. However, the government should spend more money on developing modern and functional construction. The architecture we have built nowadays is a part of our history. In addition, they represent the culture and civilization of the globalization era. The contemporary scenery of many major cities like Shanghai and Tokyo is that modern constructions are more than ancient houses. Constructing new buildings and roads can ensure the health of the economy as well as create representations of today for our descendants.

In conclusion, the government should promote citizens' standard of life, rather than spending too much money on maintenance which does not have a considerable effect.
