# Argument Writing Methodology

## Frameworks: 4-Steps

For each flaw:

	1. What is the logical flaw
	2. What the author missed
	3. Giving concrete examples
	4. Deducing the different outcome


Example:

> Recently, butter has been replaced by margarine in Happy Pancake House restaurants throughout the southwestern United States. This change, however, has had little impact on our customers. In fact, only about 2 percent of customers have complained, indicating that an average of 98 people out of 100 are happy with the change. **Furthermore, many servers have reported that a number of customers who ask for butter do not complain when they are given margarine instead.** Clearly, either these customers do not distinguish butter from margarine or they use the term 'butter' to refer to either butter or margarine.

To analyze the flaw (report conducted by many servers) in the highlighted sentence, we have the 4-Steps:

**Step 1. Logical Flaws: Result of the report may possibly be implausible**

The claim from many servers that a considerate number of customers have not complaint about margarine may be unreliable

**Step 2. Missing: Benefits that these servers could derived from a fake report**

Because the author did not consider the benefits that these servers could derived.

**Step 3. Examples: They lie may because they want to get promotion**

It is likely that the branch manager wants the policy accepted by the majority of patrons. In order to seize the opportunity for promotion, the servers lied about the patrons' satisfaction with margarine during an interview conducted by local newspaper.

**Step 4. Difference Outcome: More customer complaints**

In this case, there could have been a large number of customer complaints about the policy.

4-Steps Adaptation

	1. Question the logical flaw
	2. Asking whether there is a missing part
	3. Giving concrete examples to weaken the author
	4. Enhancing the author's argument by excluding these possibilities	

NB: Step 3 and Step 4 are similar to `if ... else ...` conditioning in coding.

Example: 
> In an attempt to improve highway safety, Prunty County last year lowered its speed limit from 55 to 45 miles per hour on all county highways. But this effort has failed: the number of accidents has not decreased, and, based on reports by the highway patrol, many drivers are exceeding the speed limit. Prunty County should instead undertake the same kind of road improvement project that Butler County completed five years ago: increasing lane widths, resurfacing rough highways, and improving visibility at dangerous intersections. **Today, major Butler County roads still have a 55mph speed limit, yet there were 25 percent fewer reported accidents in Butler County this past year than there were five years ago.**

**Step 1. Question the logical flaw: B County's road improvement is the reason of 25 percent decline**

It is questionable that Butler County's road improvement project is the main reason leading to the 25 percent decline in the number of traffic accidents.

**Step 2. Asking whether there is a missing part: Asking for alternative explanations**

To better evaluate the argument, we need to put forward a detailed question: are there any other factors resulting in fewer accidents?

**Step 3. Giving concrete examples to weaken the author**

It is possible that over the past five years, the county council had focused more on educating residents about traffic safety or implemented stricter regulations to punish anyone who violate traffic rules. And thus less traffic accidents were happened over that period of time. Therefore, either possibility could be the main primary reason for the decrease of traffic accidents, which may render the road improvement project worthless for Prunty County to adopt.

**Step 4. Enhancing the author's argument by excluding these possibilities**

On the contrary, if no other factors have triggered the decrease in the number of traffic accidents, the author will find his recommendation strengthened.

### Evidence

4-Steps Adaptation

	2. What author missed
	1. Lead to logical flaw
	3. Giving concrete examples to weaken the author
	4. Enhancing the author's argument by excluding these possibilities	
	
NB: We use Step 2 to lead Step 1 in Evidence finding.

Example: 
> ... **Today, major Butler County roads still have a 55mph speed limit, yet there were 25 percent fewer reported accidents in Butler County this past year than there were five years ago.**

**Step 2. leading Step 1. To evaluate the assumption**

First, the author needs to examine other factors which could result in fewer accidents to assist in evaluating his assumption that Butler County's road improvement project is the primary reason leading to the 25 percent decline in the number traffic accidents.

**Step 3. (Same as Question) Giving concrete examples to weaken the author **

It is possible that over the past five years, the county council had focused more on educating residents about traffic safety or implemented stricter regulations to punish anyone who violate traffic rules. And thus less traffic accidents were happened over that period of time. Therefore, either possibility could be the main primary reason for the decrease of traffic accidents, which may render the road improvement project worthless for Prunty County to adopt.

**Step 4. (Alternative sentences) Strengthen the author**

Conversely, to strengthen his statement, the author has to prove that no other factors have triggered the decrease in the number of accidents.

### Assumptions

4-Steps Adaptation

	2. What author missed
	1. Lead to logical flaw
	3. Giving concrete examples to weaken the author
	4. Enhancing the author's argument by excluding these possibilities	
	
NB: Only a little changes compared with Evidence.

**Step 2. As assumption**

First, the author assumes that no other factors have triggered the decrease in the number of accidents.

**Step 1. Depends on it**

Based on such an assumption, he believes Butler County's road improvement project is the primary reason leading to the 25 percent decline in the umber of traffic accidents.

**Logical connection**

However, since there is no evidence bolstering his assumption, it is untenable.

**Step 3. (Same as Question) Giving concrete examples to weaken the author**

It is possible that over the past five years, the county council had focused more on educating residents about traffic safety or implemented stricter regulations to punish anyone who violate traffic rules. And thus less traffic accidents were happened over that period of time. Therefore, either possibility could be the main primary reason for the decrease of traffic accidents, which may render the road improvement project worthless for Prunty County to adopt.

NB: Step 4 omitted, no need to enhance the author.

### Alternative Explanations

> Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation ...

In Alternative Explanations, we mostly focus on

	1. Facts
	2. Teasons given by the author
	3. Examples to weaken the author
	4. Strength the author

Hence, all main paragraphs should dedicated to counter the main thesis by giving alternative explanations.

We could attribute **[fact]** to **[reason]**, this is not the only explanation. **[examples]**. **[weaken thesis]**.


## Writing Templates

### Questions

First, it is questionable that **[flaws]**. To better evaluate the argument, we need to put forward a detailed question: **[question]**. **[examples]**. **[weaken]**. On the contrary, if **[contra-examples]** (it turns out to be the other way round), the author will find his recommendation strengthened.

Second, it is still open to doubt that **[flaws]**. Thus, we have to figure out, **[question]**. **[examples]**. **[weaken]**. In contrast, if **[contra-examples]** (the answers to the above questions are positive/negative), the author's proposal is advisable.

Third, whether **[flaws]** remains an unanswered question. To obtain a more persuasive judgement, we need to ask, **[question]**. **[examples]**. **[weaken]**. On the other hand, if **[contra-examples]** (the answers to the questions are reverse), it will bolster the author's suggestion.

Forth, the final question resolves around whether **[flaws]**. Therefore, we still wonder, **[question]**. **[examples]**. **[weaken]**. Conversely, if **[contra-examples]** (the opposite is true), the author's proposal is practical.

### Evidence

First, the author needs to examine **[missing]** to assist in evaluating his assumption that **[flaws]**. **[examples]**. **[weaken]**. Conversely, to strengthen his statement, the author has to prove that **[contra-examples]**.

Second, more evidence revealing **[missing]** would help the author to find out whether **[flaws]**. **[examples]**. **[weaken]**. In contrast, to bolster his claim, the author has to guarantee **[contra-examples]**.

Third, additional evidence about **[missing]** gains great significance to determine whether **[flaws]**. **[examples]**. **[weaken]**. On the other hand, the evidence indicating that **[contra-examples]** which reinforces his conclusion.

Fourth, it would be of great help to know **[missing]**, by which the author can assess his hypothesis that **[flaws]**. **[examples]**. **[weaken]**. On the contrary, **[contra-examples]** would certainly strengthen the author's statement.

### Assumptions

First, the author assumes that **[missing]**. Based on such an assumption, he believes **[flaws]**. However, since there is no evidence bolstering his assumption, it is untenable. **[examples]**. **[weaken]**.

Second, the author's statement relies heavily on another doubtful presumption that **[missing]**. Thus, it is hasty for him to rely on the presumption to consider that **[flaws]**. **[examples]**. **[weaken]**.

Third, it is still imprudent to hypothesize that **[missing]**. Based on the hypothesis, the author's speculation that **[flaws]** is arbitrary. **[examples]**. **[weaken]**.

Fourth, the author again supposes that **[missing]**. Then, he depends on the supposition/conjecture/surmise to assert that **[flaws]**. Yet, the supposition is dubious and weakens the validity of the argument due to the lack of specific information strengthening the supposition. **[examples]**. **[weaken]**.

### Alternative Explanations

First, although we could attribute **[fact]** to **[reason]**, this is not the only explanation. **[examples]**. **[weaken thesis]**.

Second, it is still hasty to assume that **[reason]** solely leads to **[fact]**. **[examples]**. **[weaken thesis]**.

Third, the causal relationship between **[reason]** and **[fact]** is open to doubt. **[examples]**. **[weaken thesis]**.

Fourth, the author again ascribes **[fact]** to **[reason]**. Nevertheless, the situation could also be explained by other reasons. **[examples]**. **[weaken thesis]**.

## Leading Paragraph & Conclusion Paragraph

What should be included in leading paragraph is

1. Thesis
2. Arguments
3. My suspicion [Template]

In compared with Leading Paragraph, Conclusion Paragraph is straightforward since you just need to conclude that the goals in the thesis of the argument by the author cannot be achieve.

### Template for Leading Paragraph

* **Question:**
Nevertheless, the argument is specious on several grounds since a number of questions regarding the author's conclusion require further analysis.

* **Evidence:**
Yet, the argument is unpersuasive as it stands because the author has failed to provide sufficient evidence to substantiate his conclusion.

* **Assumption:**
However, the argument is flawed in several critical respects as it suffers from several unreliable assumptions, which, if prove unwarranted, would challenge the author's conclusion.

* **Alternative Explanations:**
Nonetheless, the currently available information is not conclusive to define the author's statement as the only explanation capable of elucidating the fact in the argument. Several alternative possibilities could also account for the fact that the argument given.

### Template for Conclusion Paragraph

* **Question:**
To sum up, it is unreasonable for **[goals to achieve]**. We need to ask the questions mentioned above, and the answers to the questions would contribute to a better evaluation of the author's statement.

* **Evidence:**
In sum, the evidence that the author quotes does not provide conclusive information about **[goals to achieve]**. As a result, we demand additional information to better evaluate the author's conclusion.

* **Assumption:**
In sum up, whether **[goals to achieve]** is still questionable and worth further investigation. The answer could turn out to be positive, but only after the author can reasonably demonstrate the validity of his assumptions by offering more compelling evidence.

* **Alternative Explanations:**
In sum, while the assumption that **[reason]** contributes to **[fact]**, we remain open to different explanations that also help to illustrate the facts presented in the article. Unless the author offers clarification, we remain doubtful that his explanation is the only possibility.
