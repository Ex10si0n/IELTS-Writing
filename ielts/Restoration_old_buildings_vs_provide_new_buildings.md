> The restoration of old buildings in major cities throughout the world often involves numerous government expenditure. This money will bring more benifits if it is used to provide new housing or road development. To what extend do you agree or disagree.

Globally, a huge amount of spending by the state was used on the renovations of ancient architectures in the main metropoils areas. Some people argued that the funds should be used on new residential areas and driveway constructions instead. I completely agree with this.

To begin with, putting up more residential buildings will improve citizens quality of life. Due to the advancement of technology, people are pursuing a better standard of life which means a modern and stable infrastructure is significant for them. To illustrate, in the old downtown of Macao, there are many outdated apartments and drainage system has been used for many decades now. When suffering from a typhoon, these areas are usually affected the most. Consequently, authorities have taken action in building new places in the underdeveloped areas in Taipa. Many residents are moving in to new houses and enjoying a better quality of life.

Additionally, the monetary funds are also needed for the improvement of the roadways which is significant for the citizens as well. As an example, China has constructed a strengthen highway network which are able to provide sufficient transportation service for logistics and travellings. Particularly, the roadways distribution on Yangtze River Delta and the Greater Bay Area are top-level in the world. The Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao Bridge connects Hong Kong and Macao which can shorten the 2 hours commute time to half an hour. It greately convenient the residents in the Pearl River Delta on working and tourism.

In conclusion, I think that the financial resources that are supposed to be used on renovating old edifices should instead be used to build new places and develop highways.
