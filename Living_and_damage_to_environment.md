> Damage to environment is an inevitable consequence of the improvement in the standard of living. To what degree do you agree or disagree to this position?

People in every country are willing to have a higher standard of living these days, especially in the recent years that the ordinary people are the audiences of Key Opinion Leaders who like sharing their life on social media. However, the need for improvement can cause damage to the environment surrounding the people. Some deem that the advancing living condition have resulted to the destruction of surroundings which has unavoidable results. I completely agree with this opinion.

To start with, throughout history, it is necessary exploit nature to dig out resources. Electricity, which is the most significant energy nowadays, is still mainly generated from burning fossil fuels. That leads to a large scale mining for fuels like coal. As an example, Shanxi is a famous coal-producing province in China and the geological environment has been damaged since the 80s.

Furthermore, there are no cheaper alternatives to fossil fuels yet, which gives power to many industries in developing nations. For example, petrol consumption is harmful to nature but without it, some transportation systems like aeroplanes and vehicles cannot be used. Due to globalization, thousands of airlines are in operation each day, offering international logistics and commute for the people. At the same time, they are burning high-purity jet fuel. To further illustrate, one flight from San Francisco to New York can consume one-third of the gasoline, which is equivalent to the consumption of a family-use car's life cycle.

In conclusion, sacrificing the environment is the outcome of developing lifestyles. Pollution can be reduced and controlled in a reasonable range without interfering the development. Otherwise, the coming generations will pay for the public's greed. I think that it is true that the destruction of the environment is linked to the enhancement of living condition.
