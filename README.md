> The restoration of old buildings in major cities throughout the world often involves numerous government expenditure. This money will bring more benifits if it is used to provide new housing or road development. To what extend do you agree or disagree.

The most fundamental reason is that the historical and cultural value of some old buildings is unparalleled and incomparable. Take Forbidden City as an example, it is the royal palace in Ming and Qing Dynasty in China, witnessing past glories and the throne of emperor as well as representing the architectural features of that time. If the authority fails to protect those historical relics, it is a great loss for the preservation of national culture. 

In addition, the existence of old building strengthens people’s sense of identity. Unlike the high-rises and skyscrapers, which almost look the same all around the world, those architectural heritages withstood the test of time and display the unique architectural design of a region or period. What’s more, they even contribute to the boom of tourism. Every year, there are thousands of tourists both from home and abroad visiting them and appreciating their irresistible glamour. This case is often seen in the Westminster Abbey in London and Colosseum in Rome. There is no doubt that the thriving tourism earns huge profits for local government and residents. 

Nonetheless, it must be admitted that government’s funding on the furnishing new residences and road development does generate several benefits. For one thing, inhabitants have chances to live in houses with a comfortable environment and reasonable layout. For another thing, more highways can be built to connect surrounding cities and suitable road planning can be implemented to satisfy the demands of public transportation. In spite of theses, historical buildings deserve public funding for its protection; otherwise, parts of human civilization would vanish in the years to come.

In conclusion, I firmly claim that it is the obligation of government to focus on the restoration of old building as they are symbols of traditional culture and reflect the history of a country.

> Some people think that the main benefits of international cooperation is protection of the environment, but others think that the main benefit is the world business. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

Globalization increases connections between different nations. There remains some disagreement as to whether international cooperation is beneficial for the protection of environment or the boom of world business. I would discuss both views as follows. 

On the one hand, admittedly, environment deterioration poses a threat to human beings living on the earth. It is common to see haze in megacities of developing countries, the extinction of rare species in the Amazon rainforest as well as the melt of glaciers in Arctic. Although authorities in those areas aim at tackling environmental issues, the adopted technology and scientific researches fail to meet the demand. Only when the first-rate scientists around the world devote themselves to inventing environmental-friendly facilities and international environmental protection organizations make coordinated efforts, will the destruction of ecosystem be diminished and natural resources be conserved. In addition, environmental laws enacted in United Nations General Assembly not only regulate the greenhouse gas emission of its member states but also highlight the obligation to preserve biodiversity. 

On the other hand, it is undeniable that world economy does be boosted by commodity circulation among countries. For example, Chinese people can earn large number of foreign currencies by exporting agricultural products and purchase high-tech electronic devices imported from Japan or Germany via signing relevant trade contracts with business partners. Besides, the international organization such as World Trade Organization clears barriers and guarantees the liberalization of world business. It implements policies of enforcing wealthy countries to eliminate tariffs on items from poor countries and promotes multilateral trade negotiations.

As far as I am concerned, addressing environmental problems is the major benefit gained from co-operation between nations since they would share techniques and commit to keeping ecological balance in a certain area to ensure the healthy development of our planet. However, it seems that developed countries are deemed as the first beneficiaries of the world trade although international business has been stimulated.

> Children can learn effectively through watching TV. Therefore children should be encouraged to watch TV regularly both at home and at school. To what extend do you agree or disagree.

Traditionally，classroom-based education was the main source of knowledge but in recent years， it is not uncommon that children are taking advantage of the television to study. Consequently，it is suggested that they watch TV programs both in and out of school. In my opinion，it is beneficial for their all-round development despite some drawbacks.

The first point to note is that the educational programs on TV can help to consolidate knowledge learnt in class. For example，documentary and public service advertisement about the environment，usually shown at dinner， can disseminate information about our great mother nature and the environment problems facing today's world. This can be more impressive than lessons in their textbooks. 

The entertaining programs during lunch break at school can also facilitate their learning. To be more specific，most of the entertainments aiming at children are inventive and fantastic. The vibrant colors and brilliant ideas can always attract them easily and contribute to developing their creativity and innovation before they realize it. 

Some may worry that the unhealthy information on TV， like violence and pornography， would mislead students， who are often considered as having no strong sense of right and may imitate the wrongdoings blindly. However，this can be avoided if strict censorship is enforced to grade the programs and ensure that students are enjoying appropriate shows when it is their TV time and that is exactly why they should watch TV in a regular manner. 

In conclusion，television programs benefit students both academically and spiritually and they should be allowed to watch TV as long as they are protected from the malicious information.
